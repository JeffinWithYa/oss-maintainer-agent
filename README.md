A full toolkit for running an AI agent service built with LangGraph, FastAPI and Streamlit.

It includes a [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) agent, a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service to serve it, a client to interact with the service, and a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that uses the client to provide a chat interface. Data structures and settings are built with [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic).

This project offers a template for you to easily build and run your own agents using the LangGraph framework. It demonstrates a complete setup from agent definition to user interface, making it easier to get started with LangGraph-based projects by providing a full, robust toolkit.

## Overview

### [Try the app!](https://agent-service-toolkit.streamlit.app/)

<a href="https://agent-service-toolkit.streamlit.app/"><img src="media/app_screenshot.png" width="600"></a>

### Quickstart

Run directly in python

```sh
# At least one LLM API key is required
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key' >> .env

# uv is recommended but "pip install ." also works
pip install uv
uv sync --frozen
# "uv sync" creates .venv automatically
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/run_service.py

# In another shell
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

Run with docker

```sh
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key' >> .env
docker compose watch
```

## Why LangGraph?

AI agents are increasingly being built with more explicitly structured and tightly controlled [Compound AI Systems](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), with careful attention to the [cognitive architecture](https://blog.langchain.dev/what-is-a-cognitive-architecture/). At the time of this repo's creation, LangGraph seems like the most advanced and popular open source framework for building such systems, with a high degree of control as well as support for features like concurrent execution, cycles in the graph, streaming results, built-in observability, and the rich ecosystem around LangChain.

I've spent a decent amount of time building with LangChain over the past year and experienced some of the commonly cited pain points. In building this out with LangGraph I found a few similar issues, but overall I like the direction and I'm happy with my choice to use it.

With that said, there are several other interesting projects in this space that are worth calling out. I haven't spent much time with these but I hope to explore them more soon!

- [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/) and [LlamaDeploy](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_deploy)
- [CrewAI Flows](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/flows)

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit.git
   cd agent-service-toolkit
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. At least one LLM API key or configuration is required. See the [`.env.example` file](./.env.example) for a full list of available environment variables, including a variety of model provider API keys, header-based authentication, LangSmith tracing, testing and development modes, and OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. You can now run the agent service and the Streamlit app locally, either with Docker or just using Python. The Docker setup is recommended for simpler environment setup and immediate reloading of the services when you make changes to your code.

### Docker Setup

This project includes a Docker setup for easy development and deployment. The `compose.yaml` file defines two services: `agent_service` and `streamlit_app`. The `Dockerfile` for each is in their respective directories.

For local development, we recommend using [docker compose watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/). This feature allows for a smoother development experience by automatically updating your containers when changes are detected in your source code.

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose (>=[2.23.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2230)) installed on your system.

2. Build and launch the services in watch mode:

   ```sh
   docker compose watch

   ex API request body:
   {
    "topic": "Latest developments in artificial intelligence",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "thread_id": "optional-thread-id",
    "max_iterations": 3
   }
   ```

3. The services will now automatically update when you make changes to your code:
   - Changes in the relevant python files and directories will trigger updates for the relevantservices.
   - NOTE: If you make changes to the `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` files, you will need to rebuild the services by running `docker compose up --build`.

4. Access the Streamlit app by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

5. The agent service API will be available at `http://localhost:80`. You can also use the OpenAPI docs at `http://localhost:80/redoc`.

6. Use `docker compose down` to stop the services.

This setup allows you to develop and test your changes in real-time without manually restarting the services.

### Local development without Docker

You can also run the agent service and the Streamlit app locally without Docker, just using a Python virtual environment.

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install uv
   uv sync --frozen
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```sh
   python src/run_service.py
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, run the Streamlit app:

   ```sh
   streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

### Development with LangGraph Studio

The agent supports [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), a new IDE for developing agents in LangGraph.

You can simply install LangGraph Studio, add your `.env` file to the root directory as described above, and then launch LangGraph studio pointed at the root directory. Customize `langgraph.json` as needed.

### Contributing

Currently the tests need to be run using the local development without Docker setup. To run the tests for the agent service:

1. Ensure you're in the project root directory and have activated your virtual environment.

2. Install the development dependencies and pre-commit hooks:

   ```sh
   pip install uv
   uv sync --frozen
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Run the tests using pytest:

   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

## Customization

To customize the agent for your own use case:

1. Add your new agent to the `src/agents` directory. You can copy `research_assistant.py` or `chatbot.py` and modify it to change the agent's behavior and tools.
1. Import and add your new agent to the `agents` dictionary in `src/agents/agents.py`. Your agent can be called by `/<your_agent_name>/invoke` or `/<your_agent_name>/stream`.
1. Adjust the Streamlit interface in `src/streamlit_app.py` to match your agent's capabilities.

## Building other apps on the AgentClient

The repo includes a generic `src/client/client.AgentClient` that can be used to interact with the agent service. This client is designed to be flexible and can be used to build other apps on top of the agent. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous invocations, and streaming and non-streaming requests.

See the `src/run_client.py` file for full examples of how to use the `AgentClient`. A quick example:

```python
from client import AgentClient
client = AgentClient()

response = client.invoke("Tell me a brief joke?")
response.pretty_print()
# ================================== Ai Message ==================================
#
# A man walked into a library and asked the librarian, "Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Schrödinger's cat?"
# The librarian replied, "It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if it's here or not."

```
